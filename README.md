## Introduction

This code snippet is a Python script that uses the web3 library to connect to an Ethereum node, set the contract address and ABI for Aave v2, and then retrieve and decode function input data from a transaction on the Aave v2 contract.

## Prerequisites

To use this code, you will need to have Python 3 installed on your computer, as well as the web3 library. Additionally, you will need to have an Ethereum node endpoint to connect to, such as Infura or QuickNode.

## Installation

To install the web3 library, you can use pip, which is a package installer for Python. Open a command prompt or terminal and run the following command:

`pip install web3`

## Usage

To use this code, you will need to replace 'YOUR ENDPOINT GOES HERE' in the following line with your Ethereum node endpoint:

``` 
w3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('YOUR ENDPOINT GOES HERE'))
```

Finally, you can retrieve and decode function input data from a transaction on the Aave v2 contract, I provided an example transaction but feel free to change it and use this as a basis to deocode other trnasactions that you may be intrested in
